        <p><bold>Benefits of using oil-based perfumes ovr alcohol-based perfumes</bold></p>
        <p>Oil-based perfumes have several benefits over alcohol-based perfumes. Here are some of the benefits of using oil-based perfumes:</p>
        <p>Longer-lasting fragrance: Oil-based perfumes have a more concentrated and long-lasting scent than alcohol-based perfumes. The oil-based formula helps the fragrance stay on the skin for a longer time, which means you don't have to reapply it frequently.</p>
        <img class="oil" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0068/4520/2547/files/Screenshot_2023-03-16_120025_480x480.png?v=1678986414" alt="oil-based perfume">
        <p>Better for sensitive skin: Oil-based perfumes are better for people with sensitive skin. Alcohol-based perfumes can be drying and irritating to the skin, especially for those with sensitive or dry skin. On the other hand, oil-based perfumes contain natural oils, which can soothe and moisturize the skin.</p>
        <p>No alcohol smell: Oil-based perfumes don't have the strong alcohol smell that is often associated with alcohol-based perfumes. This means you can enjoy the pure fragrance of the perfume without any interference from the alcohol smell.</p>
        <p>Overall, oil-based perfumes have several benefits over alcohol-based perfumes, including a longer-lasting fragrance, better for sensitive skin, no alcohol smell, can be used on hair and clothes, and more natural ingredients.</p>

        <p><strong>How sustainable is vegan leather vs real leather?</strong></p>
        <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0068/4520/2547/articles/cactuspage6_ad7eab71-3555-467b-acf3-b84cb4106ce3_1296x.jpg?v=1676569659" alt="vegan bag">
        <p>Leather handbags have always been a fashion statement, but the traditional process of making leather comes at a high cost to the environment and animals. With the increasing awareness of the impact of animal agriculture and the production of leather, vegan leather has become a popular alternative. In this blog post, we will explore the benefits of vegan leather handbags compared to real leather.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Vegan leather is cruelty-free One of the most significant benefits of vegan leather is that it is cruelty-free. Unlike real leather, which is derived from animal hides, vegan leather is made from synthetic or plant-based materials. This means that no animals are harmed or killed in the process of producing vegan leather, making it a more ethical and sustainable choice.</li>
            <li>Vegan leather is environmentally friendly The production of real leather has a significant environmental impact. Leather production requires a lot of water, chemicals, and energy, and the tanning process generates toxic waste that can harm the environment. In contrast, vegan leather is made from sustainable materials like pineapple leaves, cork, or recycled plastic, which require fewer resources and have a smaller environmental footprint.</li>
            <li>Vegan leather is more affordable Another benefit of vegan leather is that it is more affordable than real leather. Leather handbags can be expensive due to the high cost of the raw materials and the intensive labor required to process them. In contrast, vegan leather handbags are generally more affordable, making them a practical choice for those who want to stay stylish without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>Vegan leather is more accessible Because vegan leather can be made from a wide range of materials, it is more accessible than real leather, which is limited to animal hides. This means that vegan leather is a more inclusive material that can be used by people of different cultural backgrounds, beliefs, and lifestyles.</li>
